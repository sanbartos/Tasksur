# @plasmicapp/loader-react

This is the SDK for using the Plasmic visual builder with React codebases.

To get started, see the quickstart for React:

https://docs.plasmic.app/learn/react-quickstart

If you are using Next.js or Gatsby, please instead use the specific SDKs for those: `@plasmicapp/loader-nextjs` and `@plasmicapp/loader-gatsby`.

This library uses `@plasmicapp/loader-core` under the hood.
